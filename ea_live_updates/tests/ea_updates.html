<h1>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Launch - Live Updates 🔴</h1><br>
<a href="https://pathofexile2.com/early-access">Path of Exile 2</a> has launched into Early Access! We'll be updating this thread live throughout the day with any relevant info you may need about the game's deployment. You can also follow us on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pathofexile">X</a> for updates if the site is unavailable. The times below are displayed in your local time but you will need to be logged in to view them. The latest updates will be at the top.
<br><br>
If you want to join Early Access, check out the new <a href="https://pathofexile2.com/buy-packs">Supporter Packs</a>. These packs provide you with access to the early access release as well as many exclusive microtransactions and even physical goods. Thank you for your continued support!

<h3>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Day 3</h3>
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 09, 2024 12:20 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - We're aware of some players having issues logging into their characters. We are investigating this.
<br><br>

<strong>Dec 09, 2024 5:00 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - Currently, it's a bit too easy to detonate Gas Cloud explosions when combined with persistent Ignite skills like Flame Wall. We'll be adjusting the explosion damage of both Gas Grenade and Gas Arrow for now in an upcoming hotfix.
<br><br>
In the future, we want to update it such that the potency of the Ignite or Detonator contributes to determining the damage of the Gas Cloud explosions, that way we would be able to avoid balancing around the simplest and most efficient way to apply Ignites.this.
<br><br>

<h3>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Day 2</h3>
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 08, 2024 10:15 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - We've found another skill in an unacceptable balance state. Following the same ideals as earlier, we're also going to be reducing the damage of Magnetic Salvo in the next hotfix. Note that this isn't the only skill on our radar right now but we're really just trying to address egregious cases at the moment. We're currently playing alongside you all and are also collating a lot of your feedback that we'll be addressing as much as possible in the upcoming week once the team is back in the office before the holidays. Thanks Exiles! 
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 08, 2024 12:04 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - Well we've finally hit that point where a skill with unacceptable balance has been discovered! Supercharged Slam is unfortunately dealing far too much damage than was intended given the short channel window required to hit maximum stages. We are imminently going to be reducing its damage. As much as we are trying to avoid nerfing skills and builds, it is better to do this early before it feels obligatory to use the skill. It is important that a wide variety of skills feel viable and fun to play and it simply diminishes all other abilities when one is clearly outshining the others like this. We will be starting with a heavy damage reduction on the ability in the next hotfix, which should be out within an hour. At a later time we will be making further adjustments to how long it takes to build up charges, as it is far too quick at the moment.
<br><br>
<h3>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Day 1</h3>
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 2:37 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - For anyone who purchased Path of Exile 2 on Steam, we've resolved the issue and the purchase queue should be processed in about 15 minutes. 
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 2:28 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - We should have a fix out soon for players purchasing Path of Exile 2 through Steam being unable to login.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 1:29 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - We're aware of players being unable to claim their Steam keys due to the Path of Exile website being down. Our website team currently has this as their top priority and have a plan of action to restore this service to allow you to play the game! A huge thanks for the grace being displayed by those affected.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 1:10 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - For those still in queue, what we are doing right now is letting in players in batches so that we can make sure to monitor the backend and not overload it. Thanks once again for your patience and hopefully it won't be too much longer.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 1:07 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - We're aware of an issue with players in parties sometimes being placed into parties with other random players. Until we fix this, consider it a feature to enhance your social experience! 
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 12:25 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - We've run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We'll have a fix out as soon as we can! Thank you once again and more updates will follow as we learn more.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 07, 2024 12:05 AM (GMT+3)</strong> - While our backend engineers and server administrators are hard at work fixing the problem we just wanted to put a message out there to thank them so much for everything they're doing. They have been tasked with a nearly impossible feat and have been up all night now into the morning. Their resilience and commitment to ensuring the realm is stable and provides the best experience for the players is nothing short of admirable. We couldn't ask for a better team! Thank you very much and please keep sending them your support!  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 11:46 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - The problem we ran into was due to adding more database shards in the last minute to try to support the massive player numbers. Unfortunately there was an issue which caused multiple characters to have the same character id. Thankfully the problem has now been found and is being fixed at this very moment. Your ongoing patience and support is hugely appreciated and we will continue to provide updates as we learn more.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 11:41 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - We've run into a configuration problem and need to restart the realm. Please bear with us while we address the problem.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 11:13 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - "Relatively imminent." - Jonathan  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 10:58 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - Another update, we've found a last minute crash that would have affected a majority of users that we have now fixed and is being deployed, once that's out we will be doing our final checks then opening access. If there are any further updates we will let you know immediately, once again thank you very much for your patience, we're almost there!  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 10:32 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - We've deployed the new database configuration and are working on getting everything back up and running. Our current time estimates should have access opening within the next half hour. Thanks again for your support, we'll continue to provide updates as they come.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 10:17 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - We're still working on deploying the database improvements and will keep you updated as soon as we know more. The moment we can provide a precise timeline we will. Thank you very much for your patience.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dec 06, 2024 9:15 PM (GMT+3)</strong> - We're doing some last minute database upgrades to try help handle the overwhelming amount of Exiles getting ready to LOGIN to Path of Exile 2. We're trying to get this done ASAP, but it may cause a short delay in the servers going live.
